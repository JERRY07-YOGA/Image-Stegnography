Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography
Project Overview
This Python-based application offers a secure method of hiding sensitive data within digital images using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique. The project combines steganography with AES-256 encryption to provide a highly secure way to embed confidential messages in images, allowing for covert communication while maintaining the imageâ€™s visual integrity.

Key Features
Enhanced Data Security: Combines the power of steganography with AES-256 encryption to ensure data protection.
User-Friendly GUI: A simple and intuitive interface built with Tkinter allows you to easily encode and decode messages.
Tamper Detection: Includes an automatic detection mechanism to identify if the image has been altered, which could potentially compromise the hidden message.
Invisible Data Embedding: Utilizes the LSB technique, which allows data to be hidden in such a way that it is imperceptible to the human eye, ensuring confidentiality.
Technologies & Libraries
Python 3.x: Programming language used for development.
Pillow: Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork, used for image manipulation.
Tkinter: The standard Python interface for building graphical user interfaces.
Cryptography: Library used for AES-256 encryption to secure messages.
